# alula-challenge
For the coding challenge I performed Exercise 1 where I needed to make a request to the NASA NeoWS API to get information about asteroids expected to pass near the earth during the specified range.

Languages Used:
- Node.js
- React.js
- TypeScript
## How to Run:
### For One Command (On Windows Git Bash):
`git clone https://github.com/patrickjwenzel/alula-challenge.git && cd alula-challenge && npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run start`

### Step by Step (On Windows Git Bash):
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/patrickjwenzel/alula-challenge.git`
- Move into the project's directory: `cd alula-challenge`
- Install root directory packages: `npm install`
- Move to client folder: `cd client`
- Install client packages: `npm install`
- Run the application: `npm start`

## Extra Packages Used:
- concurrently: Allows me to run the server and the client from one terminal rather than two.
- nodemon: Running the server with nodemon over node mintors changes to the files and restarts the page.
